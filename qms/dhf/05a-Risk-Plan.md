# 1. Purpose
This plan defines the risk management process for Okapi, including scoring for Severity (S) and Probability (P).

# 2. Severity Scoring (1-5)

| Score | Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Catastrophic | Potential for death or permanent injury; massive PHI breach. |
| 4 | Critical | Potential for serious injury; significant PHI breach. |
| 3 | Major | Potential for minor injury; clinical delay or error. |
| 2 | Minor | System inconvenience; no clinical impact. |
| 1 | Negligible | Purely cosmetic or non-functional issue. |

# 3. Probability Scoring (1-5)

| Score | Description | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Frequent | Expected to occur many times in the life of the system. |
| 4 | Probable | Likely to occur several times. |
| 3 | Occasional | Likely to occur at least once. |
| 2 | Remote | Unlikely but possible. |
| 1 | Improbable | So unlikely that it can be assumed not to occur. |

# 4. Risk Acceptability Matrix

| S \ P | 1 (Imp) | 2 (Rem) | 3 (Occ) | 4 (Prob) | 5 (Freq) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 (Cat)** | Low (5) | Med (10) | High (15) | High (20) | High (25) |
| **4 (Crit)** | Low (4) | Med (8) | Med (12) | High (16) | High (20) |
| **3 (Maj)** | Low (3) | Low (6) | Med (9) | Med (12) | High (15) |
| **2 (Min)** | Low (2) | Low (4) | Low (6) | Med (8) | Med (10) |
| **1 (Neg)** | Low (1) | Low (2) | Low (3) | Low (4) | Low (5) |

*   **Low (1-5)**: Acceptable.
*   **Medium (6-12)**: Acceptable if ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable).
*   **High (15-25)**: Unacceptable; mandatory risk control required.
